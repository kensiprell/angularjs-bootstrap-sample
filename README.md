This is the sample application for the [bootstrap-framework](https://github.com/kensiprell/bootstrap-framework) Gradle plugin.

It was built and tested in the following environment.

* Grails 3.0.3

* Bootstrap 3.3.5

* Font Awesome 4.3.0

* Java 1.8.0_45

* OSX 10.10.4

The most interesting sections are probably:

* The ```<head>``` elements of the [views](https://github.com/kensiprell/bootstrap-framework-sample/tree/master/grails-app/views/start)

* The [build.gradle](https://github.com/kensiprell/bootstrap-framework-sample/blob/master/build.gradle) file
